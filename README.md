### averaging_rastermaps
This repository contains all the codes prepared to get the average value of the raster maps.

* forcing_avg_series_basin.py - The grid values are averaged over the basin and if we want long-term monthly, the monthly sum is calculated for each year and then averaged over the long term.
* average_series_basin_usingfunction.py - Same thing using the function to make it easy.
